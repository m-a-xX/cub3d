# cub3d

This project consists of creating a 3D maze using the technique of raycasting. The maze will be able to manage the display of textures for the walls and the display of objects in the center of the map. To test the game, run the `make` command and run the executable created followed by the configuration file: `./cub3d map.cub`.
